  utter_faq_exchange:
  - text: You can use an available exchange voucher by following the standard purchase procedure (See here how to make a purchase from the Nike Online Store). The only difference will be in the payment step. When you reach this last step before finalizing the order, you will be able to see the payment option Vale Trocas on the left side menu. By clicking on this option, you can use the amount available in exchanges as a form of full or partial payment, that is, you can pay your order in full with the exchange voucher (if the value is enough) or pay part of the order with the voucher , complementing the payment of the excess amount with credit card or bank slip.
